## ‚ù§Ô∏è Motivation

Currently there is no native `SwiftUI` `DatePicker` for `tvOS`. That's why I created this Swift package to fill the hole üòä
The `API` mimics the one of the native `SwiftUI` `DatePicker` available for `iOS`, `macOS` and `macCatalyst`. 

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Installation

Just add this Swift package as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/crelies/TVDatePicker.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

## üß≠ Usage

The following code snippet shows how to use the `DatePicker` `view` in your `tvOS` application:

```swift
TVDatePicker(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    selection: Binding<Date>,
    minimumDate: Date,
    displayedComponents: Components = .all,
    calendar: Calendar = .current,
    dateFormatter: DateFormatter = DateFormatters.defaultFormatter,
    label: () -> Label
) // Available when Label conforms to View.
```

At first the view appears as a button with a horizontal stack containing the specified `label`, a `Text` view representing the current `selection` date string and a `disclosure indicator` `Image` view. If you press the button a sheet with the actual date picker view appears. The following screenshot is an example:

## üìñ Implementation

The `DatePicker` view is implemented by using multiple `Picker`s with the `SegmentedPickerStyle` inside a `List` / `VStack`.
Each `Picker` represents a date component like `year`, `month` or `date`. Due to issues with the focus engine the implementation slightly differs for the supported tvOS versions `13.0`, `14.0` and > `14.0`. But I think that you can ignore this detail in most cases.

## üîí Limitations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The `DatePicker` was only tested with the `Gregorian calendar`.
- The `year` component displays only `10` years at a time (`selected year +/- 5 years` with respect to the year of the specified `minimum date`).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently only the `year` component respects the `minimum date`. On the contrary `all months of a year` and `all days of a month` are visible at all time.
- Currently the `hourAndMinute` component always displays all `24 hours` of a day.
- The `hourAndMinute` component supports only steps by five for the `minute`.
